# 🌳 Comparison Between Decision Tree and Random Forest 🌲

Welcome to this project, where we explore two of the most popular machine learning algorithms: **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest**. This repository provides theoretical explanations, formulas, implementation guidance, and performance comparisons. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced data scientist, you'll find something useful here! 🚀



## 🔬 Theoretical Concepts

### 🌴 Decision Tree
A Decision Tree works by recursively splitting data based on specific conditions to reduce uncertainty or impurity. Here are some key formulas:

1. **Gini Index**:
   \[
   Gini = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i^2
   \]
   - Measures impurity of a node. Lower is better! ✅

2. **Entropy**:
   \[
   Entropy = -\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \log_2(p_i)
   \]
   - Captures the randomness or uncertainty in the data.

3. **Information Gain**:
   \[
   IG = Entropy(parent) - \sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{N_i}{N} \cdot Entropy(i)
   \]
   - Used to decide the best feature to split on.

### 🌲 Random Forest
Random Forest is an ensemble of multiple Decision Trees that work together for more robust predictions. It reduces overfitting and improves accuracy.

1. **Prediction Aggregation**:
   - **Classification**: Majority voting among all trees. 🗳️
   - **Regression**: Average of predictions across trees. 📊

2. **Feature Importance**:
   \[
   FI(feature) = \sum_{trees} (Gini_{before} - Gini_{after})
   \]
   - Helps identify which features are most influential.

3. **Bootstrap Sampling**:
   - Each tree is trained on a random subset of the data, ensuring diversity in the ensemble. 🎲
